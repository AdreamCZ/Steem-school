Text:
	With the Steem school platform we are aiming to present information about Steem as simple as possible.
	Bound by our short time we have created simple prototype representing a base of the whole platform.
	We have came up with ideas that would be in our opinion good to implement in order to achieve more helpfulness.
	And given that, it would be good to create animated video tutorials explaining the principals of Steem platform for complete beginners.
	Also forum where users experienced with the Steem platform can make tutorials and guide beginners.
	And users creating useful guides will be rewarded with Steem in order to encourage creation of more guides.
